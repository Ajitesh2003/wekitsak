## Third-Party Libraries Used

`expo`: Provides a set of tools and services for developing React Native apps.

`react-navigation`: Library for routing and navigation in React Native apps.

`react-native-vector-icons`: Customizable icons for React Native.

## UX Design Choices

The app's UX design was focused on providing a clean, user-friendly interface with the following considerations:

Sidebar Navigation

The sidebar is designed to be collapsible to provide a more focused view of the main content.
Icons are used for compact navigation when the sidebar is collapsed, and text labels are displayed when the sidebar is expanded.
Top Bar

A consistent top bar with branding and key action buttons ensures easy access to important features and user profile.
Main Content Layout

The main content is organized into clear sections with cards and lists to improve readability and ease of access to information.
Interactive elements such as buttons and scrollable lists are styled to be visually appealing and easy to use.
Responsive Design

The app is designed to be responsive, with adjustments made for different screen sizes to ensure a seamless experience on both iOS and Android devices.
